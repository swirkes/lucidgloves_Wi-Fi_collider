Composing with New Musical Instruments 
Aalto University, 2022


# [lucidgloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves) wi-fi interpreter & sound controller
with [SuperCollider](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider) and [Bela](https://bela.io).

  The main idea of this project is to sonfiy aspects of the 2.4 GHz frequency spectrum and allow the wearer
to engage with the generally invisible wave band on a sonic and tactile level. The sonic control is implemented
by sending the potentiometer data from each finger on the glove into SuperCollider. Because a potentiometer is 
such a common use case in musical applications, it easily integrates into conceivably any piece of code or patch
with a few knobs! The force-feedback provided by the servo motors creates the impression of holding an object of 
varying solidity.

  For the purposes of the the 6-week intensive workshop (which was practically 3 weeks of work on this project), 
I was able to fabricate one glove with 5 spring-loaded potentiometers that track the movement of each finger.
Additionally, I created a sample code in SuperCollider that uses the glove as an interface to control the parameters
of three different synthesizers.

  I am extremely satisfied with quality and aesthetic of the build so far. The spring mechanisms do not function fluidly
or very uniformly. When I played music with it, this apparent defect, for me became a very joyful experience that I 
was really coaxing the bits out of the digital instrument. I used a cheap work glove from Biltema along with the springs
and metal strings from retractable badge holders. It felt like a salvage project (although I was compelled to buy a lot
of new parts), so being able to feel that aspect so directly while performing with it has made me want to continue 
developing the idea.
